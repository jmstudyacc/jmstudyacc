- 👋 Hi, I’m James
- 👀 I’m interested in Networking (the kind with routers & switches), Computer Science and playing video games 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust (the lang, not the game), Vietnamese in my spare time and aspiring to learn Golang in the future
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with Rust! I will do documentation, testing, guinea pig, anything to do with Rust.
- 📫 How to reach me - feel free to reach me on jmstudyacc@gmail.com and I'll reply as best I can!
